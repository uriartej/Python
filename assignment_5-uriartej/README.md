1. Run and test a Python program.
     
## Program Instructions
1. Write a Python program that performs as a Tuffy Titan Contact List which contains a dictionary of contacts that is stored on the hard drive and that can have contacts added, modified, or deleted.
1. Create a `contacts` module to meet the following requirements:
     1. Create a file named `contacts.py`.
          1. Define a class named `Contacts`.  
               1. Define a member function named `__init__` to meet the following requirements:
                    1. Take a `self` as a positional parameter.
                    2. Take a `filename` as a keyword parameter.
                    3. Set a member variable equal to the filename.
                    4. Set a member varialbe equal to an empty data dictionary.
                    5. Open the filename and load the JSON decoded contents to the empty data dictionary.
                    6. Cleanly manage the `FileNotFoundError` if the filename does not exist.
               1. Define a member function named `add_contact` to meet the following requirements:
                    1. Take a `self` as a positional parameter.
                    1. Take a `id` as a keyword parameter.
                    1. Take a `first_name` as a keyword parameter.
                    1. Take a `last_name` as a keyword parameter.
                    2. If the id exists in the data dictionary, return the string `error`.
                    3. Set the id:[first_name, last_name] key:value pair to the data dictionary.
                    4. Sort the data dictionary in ascending order by last name, and then by first name, ignoring case.
                    5. Write the contents of the data dictionary to the filename that was set to the member variable.
                    6. Return the key:value pair that was added.
               1. Define a member function named `modify_contact` to meet the following requirements:
                    1. Take a `self` as a positional parameter.
                    1. Take a `id` as a keyword parameter.
                    1. Take a `first_name` as a keyword parameter.
                    1. Take a `last_name` as a keyword parameter.
                    1. If the id does not exists in the dictionary, return the string `error`.
                    1. Set the id:[first_name, last_name'] key:value pair to the contact dictionary.
                    4. Sort the data dictionary in ascending order by last name, and then by first name, ignoring case.
                    5. Write the contents of the data dictionary to the filename that was set to the member variable.
                    6. Return the key:value pair that was modified.
               1. Define a member function named `delete_contact` to meet the following requirements:
                    1. Take a `self` as a positional parameter.
                    1. Take a `id` as a keyword parameter.
                    2. If the id does not exists in the dictionary, return the string `error`.
                    3. Remove the key:value pair with the key equal to id.
                    5. Write the contents of the data dictionary to the filename that was set to the member variable.
                    3. Return the key:value pair with the key equal to id.

1. Run the unit testing program to ensure that your program runs as expected.

    ```
    python3 -m test   ```
       
    The unit testing will output the results of a series of tests using specific input and expected output.  Any error will provide information on where the expected output is different from the actual output.  You will need to edit your source code to fix the error and run `python3 -m test.` repeatedly until it passes all the test.

## Submission
Periodically throughout the exercise, and when you have completed the exercise, **submit the complete repository to Github**.

   <pre>git add .<br>git commit -m "<i>your comment</i>"<br>git push</pre>

In case it asks you  to configure global variables for an email and name, just copy the commands it provides then replace the dummy text with your email and Github token.

   <pre>git config --global user.email "<i>tuffy@csu.fullerton.edu</i>"<br>git config --global user.name "<i>Tuffy Titan</i>"<br>git commit -m "<i>your comment</i>"<br>git push</pre>

When you completed the final Github push, go back into github.com through the browser interface and ensure all your files have been correctly updated.  You should have the following files:
```
main.py
contacts.py
test.txt
```
