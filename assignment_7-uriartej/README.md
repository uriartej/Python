## Program Instructions
1. Write a Python program that performs as a Tuffy Titan Flight Schedule which contains a list of flight schedule data.
1. Create a `flights` module to meet the following requirements:
     1. Create a file named `flights.py`.
          1. Define a class named `Flights`.  
               1. Define a member function named `__init__` to meet the following requirements:
                    1. Take a self object as a positional parameter.
                    1. Take a filename string as a positional parameter.
                    1. Set a member variable equal to the filename.
                    1. Set a member variable equal to an empty data list.
                    1. Open the filename and load the JSON decoded contents to the empty data list.
                    1. Cleanly manage the `FileNotFoundError` if the filename does not exist.
               1. Define a member function named `add_flight` to meet the following requirements:
                    1. Take a self object as a positional parameter.
                    1. Take a origin string as a positional parameter.
                    1. Take a destination string as a positional parameter.
                    1. Take a flight number string as a positional parameter.
                    1. Take a departure string (as HHMM) as a positional parameter.
                    1. Take a next day string (as Y or N) as a positional parameter.
                    1. Take a arrival string (as HHMM) as a positional parameter.
                    2. If either the departure or arrival string is not in the proper format return a False.
                    1. Append the data to the member variable data list.
                    1. Write the JSON encode contents of the member variable data list to the filename that was set to the member variable.
                    1. Return a True.
               1. Define a member function named `get_flights` to meet the following requirements:
                    1. Take a self object as a positional parameter.
                    1. Return a formatted list of flight schedule data. For each element in the list, reformat the data as follows:
                         1. origin -> (ex: 'LAX') string with no special format.
                         2. destination -> (ex: 'ORD') string with no special format.
                         3. flight number -> (ex: '123') string with no special format.
                         4. departure -> (ex: '2:35pm') string as hours:minutesam. no leading zero on the hours. leading zero on the minutes. am/pm lowercase.
                         5. arrival -> (ex: '+11:35am') string as [+]hours:minutesam. optional plus sign for flights arriving the next day. no leading zero on the hours. leading zero on the minutes. am/pm lowercase.
                         6. duration -> (ex: '2:02') hours:minutes. no leading zero on the hours. leading zero on the minutes.
1. Create a `main` driver program to meet the following requirements:
     1. Create a file named `main.py`.
     1. Import the `flights` module.
     2. Declare a variable to hold a list of flights creating an instance object of the `Flights` class.
     6. Implement a menu within a loop with following choices:
          1. Add fight
          2. Print flight schedule
          3. Set flight schedule filename
          9. Exit the program
     7. Prompt the user for the menu choice.
     8. The Add flight menu selection should prompt the user for the origin, destination, flight number, departure time (HHMM), arrival time (HHMM), and arrival the next day (Y/N). Then call the `add_flight` member function.
     8. The Print flight schedule menu selection should call the `get_flights` member function and print a report as formatted in the below input and output.
1. Run the program using the command below and repeat the steps above until you are satisfied your program output meets the above requirements.

    ```
    python3 main.py
    ```

1. Run the unit testing program to ensure that your program runs as expected.

    ```
    python3 test.py
    ```
       
    The unit testing will output the results of a series of tests using specific input and expected output.  Any error will provide information on where the expected output is different from the actual output.  You will need to edit your source code to fix the error and run ` python3 test.sh` repeatedly until it passes all the test.

## Submission
Periodically throughout the exercise, and when you have completed the exercise, **submit the complete repository to Github**.

   <pre>git add .<br>git commit -m "<i>your comment</i>"<br>git push</pre>

In case it asks you  to configure global variables for an email and name, just copy the commands it provides then replace the dummy text with your email and Github token.

   <pre>git config --global user.email "<i>tuffy@csu.fullerton.edu</i>"<br>git config --global user.name "<i>Tuffy Titan</i>"<br>git commit -m "<i>your comment</i>"<br>git push</pre>

When you completed the final Github push, go back into github.com through the browser interface and ensure all your files have been correctly updated.  You should have the following files:
```
main.py
flights.py
test.txt
```
