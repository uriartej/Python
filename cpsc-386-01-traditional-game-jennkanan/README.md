* Then, the players will play rock paper scissors. 
* Player 1 wins the rock paper scissors, and makes up the equation : triangle squares + circles / triangles = answer 
* The first player will be: 5+3/2 = 4, the second player will be 7+2/3 = 3. 
* The first player wins this round! So, the first player recieves 1 point.
Now, keep playing this game by decreasing the time to search by 5 seconds each round until one player reaches 10 points.
